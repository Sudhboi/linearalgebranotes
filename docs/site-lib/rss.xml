A system of linear equations
has exactly one solution,
has infinitely many solutions, or,
has no solution.
If the system has at least one solution, it is said to be consistent. Otherwise, it is inconsistent.Given the system,we can construct a coefficient matrix as follows -The augmented matrix, with the right hand sides of the equations, is given below.Theorem A function hsa a unique power series expansion centered at .
Corollary - No matter how you get it, the power series will be the same.We can use substitution. For example,for all .only for . So,true for all . So, this is the taylor series for .
Eg.Since coefficient for is 0. (We see that from the power series derived before). This means that if you get any power series, it has to be equal to the taylor series of the function.Warning:as , , We can show that Therefore, the taylor expansion,Take Taylor Polynomials , the error does not go to 0.Apparently Complex Analysis explains it very well. Here, the degree 0 coefficient is zero.Degree 0 is the term.Theorem: On the open interval of convergence of ,Example: and have the same interval of convergence.
