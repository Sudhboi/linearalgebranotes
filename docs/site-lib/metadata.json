(Multiplying would introduce higher powers of vectors, which would behave non-linearly.)The Schrodinger Equation is Linear!Here, vector addition is called superposition.A scalar (constant) scales stuff (whaaatt??????)Linear combinations are the polynomials of Linear Algebra.The span of a (single) vector is all vectors , for a given vector . For two vectors, the span is the set of all linear combinations of the two. This means that if one vector does not belong to the span of the other (i.e., they are linearly independent), the span of both vectors form a plane. In general, the span of independent vectors gives us an -dimensional space.The number of independent vectors we can find in a space is called the dimension of that space. It tells us how many independent degrees of freedom we have.We pick a point on a plane to represent the zero vector. In principle, vectors are not free to move around in linear algebra. (Any span must always run through the origin.) A line is a subgroup of a plane (yay group theory!) The cosets are other parallel lines that don't go through the origin. A vector space is any set of vectors that can be added and scaled. A line is not only a subgroup, but also a subspace. The span of any set of vectors will be a subspace.We then pick any two vectors that are linearly independent (for a 2d plane), and we call them the basis vectors. We usually work with orthonormal bases (the vectors are orthogonal and of unit length.) We can now compose any vector into a linear combination of the bases.Here, and are called the coordinates. They are usually written as follows.This decomposition is unique.Mathematically speaking, an -dimensional vector space is isomorphic to a set of -tuples with addition and scaling.Coordinates are basis-dependent. Coordinates try to compensate for the change in basis (called contravariance).

We can now get the distance between two vectors and by taking .The dot product can also be written as follows -This gives us a nice formula for the angle between two vectors.The elements of a vector don't all have to be the same type. However, computing the dot product may not always be possible for such a vector.The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is 0. Orthogonal vectors are said to be maximally independent of each other. The dot product can also be used as a measure of correlation/similarity.The dot product is always . This can be seen by the following -where is the th element of the vector.
